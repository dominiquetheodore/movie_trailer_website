submission for P1 of Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer nanodegree.

## About 
The movie trailer website project consists of server side code that stores a list of movies and their info (title, release year, storyline, poster etc). The page is dynamically generated from the Python data structure, and allows the user to view the movie trailer. 

### Requirements

`easy_install Jinja2`

or

`pip install Jinja2`

### Usage
- run `python freshtomatoes.py` in your browser to display the dynamic webpage. The movies list is stored in a file named "movies.json", which is parsed at runtime to create the movie instances.
